In an upcoming [toepoke.co.uk](https://toepoke.co.uk) build I've added the ability to e-mail all the players in a match.  Just for simple stuff like arranging lifts, last minute changes, etc.

I didn't want to get into creating a full blown e-mailing system, [there's an app for that](http://mail.google.com/mail) :D.  Instead I simply used a normal [mailto](http://css-tricks.com/snippets/html/mailto-links/) link, which brings up whatever e-mail client is installed.

Now this works fine if the user has an e-mail client installed, but what if you use web based e-mail client?  

If you're interested in knowing more, please [read the full article with demos, code and full explanation of the plug-in](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1055915/blog/many-mail/demo.html)

Please note that version **1.0.2** has been released today (01-Jul-11). Â The above article has been updated to reflect the changes

nHope you find this useful!
