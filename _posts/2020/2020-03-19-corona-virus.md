We're living in strange times at the moment.  Many of us (me included) have never experienced a pandemic on this scale.

I [ran a poll](https://twitter.com/toepoke_co_uk/status/1238946596844429312) last weekend to see if people we're 
planning to play football the following week.  Most were still looking to play, but even though it was only 5 days ago I 
suspect the answers would be quite different today.  We're playing tonight and I suspect that will be our last game for quite a while.

If you're planning to continue playing, please be mindful of the [NHS advice](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/) 
and of course if you're showing symptoms then **do not play**.

If, like I, you're looking to suspend your football for the foreseeable future here's what you can do to stop all the emails going out
to your squad:

1. Navigate to your [dashboard](https://toepoke.co.uk/permalink.aspx)
2. Click the **my squads** button at the top of the screen
3. Click the **change template** button
4. Select the **My Timeline** tab
5. Under the **Active** column uncheck each reminder
6. Click **save** to confirm the changes

Once it's safe to come back to football just follow the above steps and tick the reminders you want to put back on.

You may also want to cancel any matches you already have planned.

1. Click the **my matches** button at the top of the screen
2. Find the match you want cancel
3. Click the **cancel match** button
4. Enter a reason, and click **ok**

Stay safe and I hope we all come out the other side without any negative impact.

Take care.<br/>
Team TP.
