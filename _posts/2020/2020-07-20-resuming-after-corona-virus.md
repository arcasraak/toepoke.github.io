It's been 4 months [since we stopped playing football](https://toepoke.github.io/2020/03/19/corona-virus.html).  As venues start to reopen we need to be mindful that the virus is still with us and [take precautions](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/recreational-team-sport-to-return-safely-this-summer) to minimise the risk of passing the disease onto our friends and family.

_**Remember just because [you aren't showing symptoms](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-53320155) doesn't mean you haven't got the virus.**_

With that said, let's look at how we can enable our games to start inviting people back to football.

Assuming you [suspended](https://toepoke.github.io/2020/03/19/corona-virus.html) your games at the start of lockdown, re-enabling is simply a reverse of those steps:

1. Navigate to your [squad dashboard](https://toepoke.co.uk/squad.aspx/dashboard)
2. Click the **change template** button on the appropriate squad
3. Select the **My Timeline** tab
4. Under the **Active** column check each reminder you want to activate
5. Click **save** to confirm the changes

Take care.<br/>
