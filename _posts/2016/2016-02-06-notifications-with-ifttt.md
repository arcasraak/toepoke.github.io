<p class="beta">

If you haven't used [if-this-then-that](https://ifttt.com) with [toepoke](https://toepoke.co.uk) before, you'll want to 
look at [setting it up with toepoke first]({% post_url /2016/2016-02-06-if-this-the-that-integration %}). It's cool, I'll wait ... <img src='/images/grin.png' alt='grin' title='grin' />

## Installing ifttt mobile app

First off you'll need to install the if-this-then-that app from either the [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ifttt/id660944635) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ifttt.ifttt) app stores.
Here's how to install it for Android:

## Recipe 

Once you've installed the app on your phone you'll need to set-up a recipe to tell ifttt what toepoke notifications you want to know about.

Here's the lowdown on setting up a notification recipe, or alternatively [here's one we created earlier](https://ifttt.com/recipes/377413-toepoke-send-me-a-notification-when-something-happens-to-my-match).
