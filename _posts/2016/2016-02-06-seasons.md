We [recently](https://toepoke.co.uk/about.aspx/change-log?version=1.2.0012) started capturing the results of your matches. 
I hope you've been adding them as you're now going to find out why <img src="/images/smile.png" alt="smile" title="smile" />.

**Seasons** is a simple concept which follows the notion of [domestic football league](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_association_football_season).

## Team Statistics

<img class="img-center" src="/images/posts/2016/2016-01-03-team-stats.png" width="627" height="435" alt="Team statistics" />

Here we can see:

1. Which team won the season overall (most points).
2. Graph showing number of goals scored by each team (per match).
3. Top scorers for the season.
4. Results of each match during the season.

Particularly useful if you use the same sides each week, you can see how they marry up over time.

## Player Statistics

You can also see how **you** performed over the season.  It's like your own [Opta Sports](http://www.optasports.com/) statistician! <sup><a href="#kind-of">*</a></sup>

<img class="img-center" src="/images/posts/2016/2016-01-03-player-stats.png" width="657" height="379" alt="Player statistics" />

As you can see, there's a lot of information here! 

1. Which player gained the <a href="https://toepoke.co.uk/about.aspx/glossary#mvp">Most Valuable Player</a> award.
2. Player form at a glance, how many did you win, lose or draw.
3. How many times you appeared on each team.
4. Player ratings, as voted by your team mates.
5. Match by match breakdown of your performance, including:
	- Team you played on.
	- How many goals you scored.
	- Points awarded for the match.
6. [Breakdown of your match points](#how-points-are-calculated).
7. View stats from previous seasons.
	- [toepoke](https://toepoke.co.uk) stores the last 3 months of data.  The number of past seasons you can view is determined by the [size of your season](#season-size). 






## How **points** are calculated

For team points it's a simple <strong>3</strong> points for a win, <strong>2</strong> for a draw and <strong>zero</strong> for a loss.

There are a variety of points available for individuals.

<table class="points">
	<thead>
		<tr><th>Stat</th><th>Points</th><th>Description</th></tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Attendance</td>
			<td>2</td>
			<td>
				You get <strong>2</strong> points just for turning up as promised!
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Goals</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>
				<strong>1</strong> point for each goal you scored.
				<br /> 
				<span class="footnote">
					Note: <a href="#managers">Managers</a> can change your goal score if you decide to add another 20 when you scored 1 <img src="/images/wink.png" alt="wink" title="wink" />. 
				</span>		
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>MOTM</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>
				<strong>1</strong> point for being awarded <a href="https://toepoke.co.uk/about.aspx/glossary#motm">Man of the Match</a>.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Win</td>
			<td>3</td>
			<td>
				If <i>your</i> team wins, you get <strong>3</strong> points - just like in association football.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Draw</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>
				<strong>1</strong> point if the result is a draw.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Loss</td>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>
				<strong>zero</strong> points are awarded if <i>your</i> team losses.
			</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>  

## Season size

By default seasons are 10 matches long (so this may be 10 weeks if you play every week, or 20 weeks if you play every fortnight).

<img class="img-center" src="/images/posts/2016/2016-01-03-season-size.png" width="664" height="368" alt="Season size template option" />

Seasons can be <strong>5</strong>, <strong>10</strong> or <strong>15</strong> matches long, depending on the preference of you and your squad.

Don't like the seasons feature? That's fine, just select <strong>No Seasons</strong> instead.

All this can be changed from your <strong><a href="https://toepoke.co.uk/squad.aspx/dashboard" rel="nofollow">squad dashboard</a></strong> (<strong>my squads => squad template</strong>).

## Managers

Find someone is making up how many goals they've scored? <a href="https://toepoke.co.uk/about.aspx/glossary#manager">Managers</a> 
can review and change the goals scored by players on their [stats screen](#player-statistics).

## Signing off ...

Hope you find the new <strong>seasons</strong> feature brings out the banter in your matches a little more.  How are you finding it?

And remember, you can also <a href="https://toepoke.uservoice.com/forums/36616-general">suggest improvements</a>.

Until next time!<br/>
Team TP.
