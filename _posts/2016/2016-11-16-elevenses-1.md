<strong>
Elevenses is a series of posts around the subject of computer programming and building websites, not football.  Sorry.
Just so you know.
<strong>

I've been an avid follower of Chris Alcock's excellent [The Morning Brew](http://blog.cwa.me.uk/) for many years.
But I don't just follow Chris' RSS feed, but many others too.

A while ago I started e-mailing around links to work colleagues from the sources I'd picked up.
So as an experiment I'm starting a similar *Morning Brew* collection of links called [elevenses](http://localhost:4000/tags/elevenses/).

This is issue one, but I've gone back to old e-mails too, starting with [-1]({% post_url /2016/2016-11-04-elevenses--1 %}) #seewhatIdidthere 
:grin:.

So without *ado being furthered*, here we go!
