## tlk.io

[tlk.io](https://tlk.io) is a great little service that provides chat facilities online. We've always wanted to increase the communication for players on [toepoke](https://toepoke.co.uk), so naturally we've repurposed it.

## Setup

Next time you visit [toepoke.co.uk](https://toepoke.co.uk) you'll be prompted for your nickname:

<img class="img-center" src="/images/posts/2016/2016-05-28-tlkio-nickname-prompt.png" width="396" height="290" alt="Your nickname" />

Simply enter your chosen nickname and you're setup.  You can change your nickname at any time from [your profile](https://toepoke.co.uk/user.aspx/edit). 

## Having a chat

Once your nickname is setup you'll see the chat window appear<a class="footnote" href="#why-squad-or-match">*</a>.

<img class="img-center" src="/images/posts/2016/2016-05-28-tlkio-chatting.png" width="354" height="469" alt="Having a chat ..." />

I've been using it to have captains pick sides <img src="/images/smile.png" alt="smile" title="smile" />

Have a read of the [tlk.io](https://tlk.io/) website for more tips and tricks.

Until next time!<br/>
Team TP.

  <span class="footnote">*</span>
  If you're a member of multiple squads, you'll only see the chat window on squad and match screens. This is so we know who you're wanting to chat with.
