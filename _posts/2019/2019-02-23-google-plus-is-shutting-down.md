As you may be aware Google+ is [shutting down in April 2019](https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/expediting-changes-google-plus/).  

If you _only_ have the ability to log into [your account](https://toepoke.co.uk/user.aspx/edit) using Google+ you will no longer be able to so after April.

You can fix this by visiting the [change password](https://toepoke.co.uk/account.aspx/change-password) screen, or by following these simple steps:

1. Enter **https://toepoke.co.uk** into your browser
2. Click **my account**
3. Click **change my password**
4. Enter your new password
5. Click **OK**

You'll then be able to log in with your email address and newly created password.

If you do not apply a password before Google+ [closes](https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/expediting-changes-google-plus/), you will need to use the [reset password](https://toepoke.co.uk/account.aspx/reset-password) facility to create a password.

If you decide the website is not for you, you can [close your account](https://toepoke.co.uk/account.aspx/close-account) any at time.  Alternatively your account will be deleted after a year of inactivity. 

Until next time.<br/>
Team TP.
