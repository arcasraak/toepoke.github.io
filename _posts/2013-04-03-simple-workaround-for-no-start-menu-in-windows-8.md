I recently went with Windows 8 and if you’ve gone down this path you’ll no doubt have noticed the absence of a Start Menu in Desktop mode.

A few utilities have cropped up, some free, some paid for which add some variation of this missing feature.

I’m not a huge fan of adding lots of little apps to my system as it leads to needing another rebuild in 6 months time.  I’ve only just installed the new OS!

Besides I only want it for a short time until I pin all my regular applications to the taskbar.  So here’s a quick tip you may also find useful.

1. Right click on the **Taskbar** and select **Toolbars** > **New Toolbar**
<img src="/images/posts/2013-04-03-windows-8-start-menu.png">
2. In the resulting dialog, navigate to your **Programs** folder, which will be something like:
<br/>**C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs**
3. You should now have a menu **Toolbar** marked **Programs**
4. Simply click the little arrow next to **Programs** and enjoy a noddy start menu.

If you prefer your menu in a more traditional place, you can unlock the taskbar and drag the Programs toolbar to the left.

Hope this helps.
