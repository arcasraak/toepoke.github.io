It's been a long time since the 2010/11 football season finished.  No football for 3 months, with exception to the [Womens World Cup](http://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/index.html), unlucky girls.

With the [2011/12](http://www.premierleague.com/) season almost upon us we thought we'd set-up a [Fantasy League](http://fantasy.premierleague.com/) for our users.  It's just a bit of fun.

If you'd like to join in, simply:

1. Sign-up with [fantasy.premierleague.com](http://fantasy.premierleague.com/).
2. Click the **LEAGUES** tab.
3. Click **Join a league**.
4. Select **Private League**.
5. When prompted enter the code **176362-55928**
6. Click **JOIN PRIVATE LEAGUE**.

Hope to see you there!
