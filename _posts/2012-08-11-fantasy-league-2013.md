You may recall we ran a Fantasy League last year for a bit of fun.

With the 2012/13 season upon us, we’ve re-enabled the league.  If you joined last year you shouldn’t need to do anything.  If you’d like to join in, simply follow these steps.

If you’d like to join in, simply:

1. Sign-up with [Fantasy Premier League](http://fantasy.premierleague.com).
2. Click the **LEAGUES** tab.
3. Click **Join a league**.
4. Select **Private League**.
5. When prompted enter the code **815363-206955**
6. Click **JOIN PRIVATE LEAGUE**.

Hope to see you there!
