A few weeks ago version 1.9.0 of [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com) was pushed out. This includes some fixes, depreciated methods and some new widgets.

It’s taken a few weeks, but I’m happy to say that my little API, [Fluqi](http://fluqi.apphb.com/Home/History) has been updated to take these into account.

Full details in the [change log](http://fluqi.apphb.com/Home/History)

Until next time.
