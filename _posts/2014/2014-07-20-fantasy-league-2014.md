Been running this the last few years.  No prizes (sorry), just a bit of fun.

With the 2016/17 season upon us, I've re-enabled the league.  If youâ€™d like to join in, simply follow these steps.

1. Sign-up with [Fantasy Premier League](http://fantasy.premierleague.com).
2. Click the **LEAGUES** tab.
3. Click **Create and join new leagues**.
4. Select **Join a league**, then **Next**.
5. Select **Join private league**. 
6. When prompted enter the code **164791-53557**

Hope to see you there!
