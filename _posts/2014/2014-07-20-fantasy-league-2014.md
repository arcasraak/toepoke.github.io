Been running this the last few years.  No prizes (sorry), just a bit of fun.

With the 2013/14 season upon us, I've re-enabled the league.  If youâ€™d like to join in, simply follow these steps.

1. Sign-up with [Fantasy Premier League](http://fantasy.premierleague.com).
2. Click the **LEAGUES** tab.
3. Click **Join a league**.
4. Select **Private League**, then **Next**.
5. When prompted enter the code **179955-50037**
6. Click **JOIN PRIVATE LEAGUE**.

Hope to see you there!
