## Pingdom
With Pingdom [closing it's free plan](https://venturebeat.com/2019/01/07/pingdom-will-kill-its-free-website-monitoring-plan-on-february-6/) I've been looking at alternative providers, which I thought were worth sharing:

* [Uptime Robot](https://uptimerobot.com/)
* [StatusCake](https://www.statuscake.com/)
* [updown.io](https://updown.io/)

For reference, I'm trying [StatusCake](https://www.statuscake.com/) out.  Only been using it for a few days, but looking good so far.
