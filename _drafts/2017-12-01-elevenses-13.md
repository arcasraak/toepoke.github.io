## If you run a website, and under SSL, read this section ...
I was looking through the DevTools for [toepoke](https://toepoke.co.uk) this weekend and noticed this warning had suddenly appeared:
> The certificate used to load https://toepoke.co.uk uses an SSL certificate that will be distrusted in Chrome 66. Once distrusted, users will be prevented from loading this resource. See https://g.co/chrome/symantecpkicerts for more information.

In essence there are plans to [distrust Symantic certifications in a future version of Chrome](https://security.googleblog.com/2017/09/chromes-plan-to-distrust-symantec.html).
